# Project14-IoT-Parking-Management-System
IITP Summer Program 2021 Project 14

Parking is a worldwide issue, whether on university campuses or in congested urban areas. Parking garages and lots are expensive and utilize large spaces that could be used much more effectively and profitably for both private companies and municipalities. This project will look at using an IoT system to maximize the efficiency of parking areas, benefitting drivers, companies, and municipalities.
